__DESCRIPTION__

[New York Perl Mongers](http://www.meetup.com/The-New-York-Perl-Meetup-Group/) (NY.pm) was formed in 1997. It was the first of the Perl Mongers groups, a loose association of over a hundred Perl user groups around the world. In 2011, the NY.pm group, the NY Perl Seminar group and the New York Perl Meetup group merged under the "New York Perl Mongers" banner to collectively coordinate activities for the New York Perl community. The NY.pm mailing list is used for general discussion and Meetup.com is used for scheduling events.
