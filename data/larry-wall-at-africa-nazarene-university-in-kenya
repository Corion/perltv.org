Charles Ouma interview Larry Wall while he visited the
<a href="http://www.anu.ac.ke/">Africa Nazarene University</a> in Kenya.

<div class="charles_ouma">
I wanted to know how do you combine the Perl programming language,
since you initiated it, into a tool of ministry, or how does it help
with ministry?
</div>

<div class="larry_wall">
Well, you know a programming language is not really necessarily spititual on its
own, but it has more to do with how I think the community should work,
and the fact that I as the believer can hear what peoples needs are and
meet them.
</div>

<div class="charles_ouma">
....I wanted to ask how did you get started Perl programming?
You talked about it often but
</div>

<div class="larry_wall">
Sure, well I had an itch to scratch and I had a problem to solve and the
tools that I was working with weren't up to the ...

Started off with a beginning of an idea, and then as people started using it
and liking it I started to recognize what the real need was and developed
Perl into that need that people had for a text processing language.
</div>

<div class="charles_ouma">
To a layman, how does 
</div>

<div class="larry_wall">
Well, if you are not familiar with programming, in normal terms it's like following
a recepie, or writing a recepie. Perl is a particular kind of cooking, if you will,
Perl, as a programming language is about cooking text files.

Files like language or files of ... that the computer would spit out that are logging
information 

anything that's happening periodically.

And you might want to just scan through that and do something. That is the sort of...
that Perl was initially written for, and still at its heart is a text processing
language.
words, and sentences and lines of text.
and makes it very easy to deal with that sort of "food".

There is even a book, I did not write it, called the Perl Cookbook.

A friend of mine wrote that. It has recepies 
</div>

<div class="charles_ouma">
I just wanted to know what   living  you give it out as open source.
What exactly how do you make your profit?
</div>

<!-- 3:34 -->
<div class="larry_wall">
There's various way you can make money. In my case I wrote a book and I get royalties
and sometimes a company will pay you back in terms of stock options or
something like that.
You can offer to support people so you can have support contracts
or sell things that are associated with,
you know peole sell t-shirts and goodies of various sorts that are
associted with various open source projects.

Mostly though people make a living by persuading a company to hire
them to do open source software.

I actually do it myself mostly right now.
I work for a very nice company called ... Logic Microsystems 
and mostly they pay me to work on Perl and that's becaus they use Perl a lot
so it helps them I can tell them how to program Perl better
and when they have ideas I can feed that back to the Perl community in
ways that will help them.
So its a two-way street, in biological terms, symbiosis and so
its often in the companies best interest to have some experts

if you can learn one well enough a company will be interested
in hiring you just to take care of that relationship.
</div>

<div class="charles_ouma">
It's almost, like you said a symbiotic relationship.
</div>

<div class="larry_wall">
Yes, and it's actually very difficult for a company to give money to a project.
It is difficult to set that up. It is very easy for a company to hire somebody
to work on a project. 
</div>

<div class="charles_ouma">
Great, so I wanted to know, is that all that you do,
other programming language coming out is Perl your baby 
</div>

<div class="larry_wall">
Perl is my big baby. It is probably my life work I've done other things
other programs I wrote and gave away, somewhat successful.

You there are two kinds of writers. There are people who write a story and put it away.
Then write another story and put that away.

Then there are writers who are more like Toolkin where everything they do
ends up in the same story.
More or less.
I am more like that. So instead of just making more projects out there
make it an aspect of perl.
I am interested in an awful lot of things.
That's one of my problems that I am interested in too many things.
I play ... at the church. I play the drums I don't know how I ... that up

One of the way I hook(?) a lot of thing in is 
talks at the open source conference every year, and I usually talk 
about Perl and something else, so 
Perl and Chemistry, Perl and Music, Perl and Games, Perl and this and that and
the other thing so, you know, if you can't figure out 

pick something random and look at the relationship of that to the thing you are
interested in.
That's a very easy way to ... up with ideas.
At least it works for me.
</div>

<!-- 07:36  -->
<div class="charles_ouma">
What is the stranges comments you received from people that just walking on the
street Larry ... 
</div>


<div class="larry_wall">
We went to a movie to an art theatre in Cupertino I don't remember the movie,
but the guy who sold the movie tickets <i>you are Larry Wall</i>
You know, sometimes people ask for autographs or pictures, and 
I am quite happy to do that it is meaningful for them and it is not 
a problem for me. You know, fame is just another thing that happens,
when you look back to your life and you see that's God that 
putting you in that position you can't take credit yourself 
I am more happy to what God wants ...
and I'll use the fame as one more tool to try doing thing that
... doing certainly not something to celebrate 
</div>

<div class="charles_ouma">
Now, what are some of the benefits that people have gained from using Perl
</div>

<!-- 09:10 -->
<div class="larry_wall">
Well, you know, it has been said that every computer language teaches
you to think differently and so on that level 
...
people ...
I think that the sort of comments 
I used to hate programming and then I starte to use Perl and now
I love programming. some of that is because the culture is fun
and some the language makes it easy to do certain kind of things
That's sort of on a psychological level that is the benefit
on a financial benefit, many people make their livings 
programming Perl for company for

A lot of web designers use Perl these days still.
A lot of people sort of a hobby

or they might use another language, but 
I think just the fact that it makes some things easy 
that no other language makes it easy 
what makes people like Perl.
