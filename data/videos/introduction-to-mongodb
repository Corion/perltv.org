__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the Perl Oasis 2012.

This talk will introduce the features of MongoDB by walking through how
one can building a simple location-based application using MongoDB.
The talk will cover the basics of MongoDB's document model, query language,
map-reduce framework, using the Perl driver and deployment architecture.

The talk will be made up of a bunch of different talks and will
be a great blend for those people in the Perl community!
