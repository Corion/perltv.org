__DESCRIPTION__

Are you using MetaCPAN? Do you want to hook up to its cool API? Wrong number?!

MetaCPAN::API is an interface to MetaCPAN's API (get it?) that allows a comfortable access to the data MetaCPAN has to offer.

Version 1.000 has been rewritten from scratch and I would like for you to be aware of it, and to use it. Come see what the hell I'm talking about. Also, bring chips.
