__DESCRIPTION__

* Perlfully beautiful

* Dancer is awesome.

The main problem with Dancer is that almost everything is implemented as a Singleton which means they are basically globals.
That's where Dancer2 comes in. It is a clean and nice rewrite of Dancer without any globals.


Dancer 2 becoming a business priority where the business of a company depends on it. This will let people
to devote some company time to working on Dancer 2, and even secure company financing.

Including an example of an asynchronous application using Dancer2, AnyEvent and Twiggy.
