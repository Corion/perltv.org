__DESCRIPTION__

Unicode defines all characters in common use throughout the world and standards
for parsing, collating, and normalizing textual data. It provides the only
official encodings for many protocols, languages, and serialization formats
including JSON, YAML, and XML. Websites, applications, and services have to be
developed with an understanding of Unicode and can greatly benefit from the
features it provides. Fortunately, Perl is the premiere language for Unicode
programming and is rich in functionality. This talk will bring you up to speed
on Unicode and its encodings and then dive into Perl hacking with Unicode.
