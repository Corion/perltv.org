__DESCRIPTION__

Remember the saying from Perl-people? "We suck at marketing". Well, not all of us. Some of us are rather good at marketing. Some well-known Perl heroes are good at what they do and good at promoting that, and promoting Perl at the same time. I do my bit and it seems to be appreciated every now and then. I will tell you what I do for marketing Perl, what I think the effect of that is, and how easy it is for you to join me to show other people how awesome Perl is. I will mention some of my Perl heroes, YAPC's, Fosdem, workshops, PM meetings, tuits, buttons, stickers, and more.
