__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2009.

Over the last year the Perl community has been dabbling in areas that has typically shunned before. The "M" word has been heard mentioned in public and some of us are using it without any discernible shame or embarrassment.

In this talk we'll look at what has been going on - and why. And we'll try to work out if we've had any success.

I might even tell you what the "M" word is.
