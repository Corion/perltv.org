__DESCRIPTION__

[David Wheeler](http://justatheory.com/)'s [PgTAP](http://pgtap.org/) (as well as [MyTAP](http://theory.github.io/mytap/) for MySQL) is a handy,
easy to use and easy to learn TAP testing framework which should be part of the toolbox of every Perl developer. 

Staying within the TAP testing style we are used to in Perl, PgTAP makes it very easy to whip up simple and not-so-simple database unit tests. 

This is an overview of the features of PgTAP and a couple of common test cases which might come in handy in everyday use of a database. 

Examples are shown in Postgres/PgTAP.
