__DESCRIPTION__

[source](https://github.com/eilara/Rx.pl)

A library for composing async programs. Because writing async code is hard,
but working with Perl lists is easy. Lets turn events into lists, and reap
the benefits:

* Elegant async programming without callback nesting, using operators we
  all know from working with Perl lists

* Managing and coordinating events, e.g. start an HTTP request when timeout
  on key press if previous HTTP request was OK and arrived in the last
  10 seconds

* Programming with stream transformations, instead of objects and methods-
  say hello to beautiful functional designs with well defined state and
  side-effects . Replace boring UML diagrams with fun marble diagrams

* Stop writing and rewriting retry, timeout, throttle, buffer, window,
  counters, caching, and aggregate functions for each project. Instead
  create your processes as observables, then enjoy a rich library of
  existing operators
