__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2010

A story of how we went about packaging perl and all of the dependencies that our project has.
Where we were before, the chosen path, and the end result.
The pitfalls and a view on the pros and cons of the previous state of affairs versus the pros/cons of the end result.
