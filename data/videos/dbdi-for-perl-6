__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2010

The DBDI project aims to provide a low-level database driver interface for Perl 6 and Parrot. DBDI provides a common low-level API on which high-level interfaces, like MiniDBI and DBI v2, can be built for Perl 6 and other languages targeting Parrot.

This talk will cover the role of DBDI, the rationale behind it, the current state and future plans of the project, and how you can get involved.
