__DESCRIPTION__

Merijn Brand (Tux) starts by showing the default way to use Text::CSV to read and write CSV files.
Then he explains how those 8-10 lines of code were turned into a single function to make it simpler.

Implemented the RFC 7111 specification, [URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/csv Media Type](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111).

    $csv->fragment($io, "col=3:8");

Callback to be called after each logical line was processed.

In order to view the [slides](http://tux.nl/Talks/CSVu/) you need to use FireFox with the "Space Next" plugin and then press SPACE for the next page and backspace/delete for the previous page.
Opera supports it by default. Chrome has a FastForward plugin that ought to support that, but it doesn't work (yet)
