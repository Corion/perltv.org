Quotes
---------

Nothing ever gets rolled out on a Friday.

Nothing ever gets rolled out later than Wednesday.

If it hurts, Do it More Frequently, and Bring the Pain Forward.
And Automate it.

The Deployment Pipeline
-----------------------
* We develop
* We push our code to a repository
* Our CI server is watching our repository for updates (polling every few minutes)
* Every time it finds new commit in the repository it creates a full check-out
* Builds a clean environment from scratch
* If it passes the unit tests then the build gets archived in a repository
* The build moves to the next stage of the deploymet pipeline.
* Where we can run automated acceptance test or manual test etc.


Pinto - Curate a Perl Rerpository

For Acceptance test use a language that users can speak (and not code).
Sources on Cucumber BBD: Specification by Example, The Cucumber book

There are a number of modules on CPAN that can do similar things.

Maturity Model
---------------
* Do you use version control?
* etc...
