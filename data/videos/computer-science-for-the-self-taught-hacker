__DESCRIPTION__

Description:
Are you a programmer without a Computer Science background? Self-conscious about what you might be missing? Don't have a favorite sorting algorithm? Let's get that chip of your shoulder! I'll introduce you to CS theory: ideas, terminology, math, and nomenclature and then show you how to dig deeper by leveraging Open Courses (and your local library)

Abstract:
What is Computer Science and how is it different than Programming? What did I miss by jumping straight into programming?
This quick tour of topics covered in introductory computer science courses discusses why those topics are considered important. I'll provide links to delve deeper in books and online courses.

After this talk, you'll be able to answer:
Why do we discuss complexity?
How do we reason about programs? What can we prove? What can't we prove?
What is Big-O notation and why should I care?
Why do data structures matter?
Why do we care about sorting?
