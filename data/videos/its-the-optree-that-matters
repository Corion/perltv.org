__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2011

People fuss a lot about source code syntax (MooseX::Declare) and layout (especially indentation). They're wasting their time: the syntax doesn't matter at all! Perl executes the optree, not the source code. Learn to embrace what really matters about your programs.
