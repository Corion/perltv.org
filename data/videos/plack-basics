__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2011

Plack sits between your web server (Apache, Starman, FCGI) and your framework/code (Catalyst, Dancer, Mojo, or Web::Simple or your own raw code).

This makes changing web server easy - but it also means you can use any of the generic Plack::Middleware layers, from access logs to debugging, to serving static content.

You get a standalone web server for free, which make development much easier!

I'll also briefly cover general best practices with server configuration (proxies, caches and fail over).
