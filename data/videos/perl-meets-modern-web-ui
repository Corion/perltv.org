__DESCRIPTION__

Creating Single Page Webapps with Perl as the back-end.

Web Frameworks for the client such as
[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/),
[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/),
and [Angular](http://angularjs.org/)
have changed how we build web applications.

Rendering's on the client now.
Do you want to take advantage of that?
How do you take advantage of that?

In this talk I'll walk you through [an example web application](https://github.com/whump/yapcna2013)
that sends a skeletal UI over the wire to the browser,
then builds grid and detail views using JavaScript,
out of data returned over a API implemented in Perl.
