__DESCRIPTION__
Creating Single Page Webapps with Perl as the back-end.
<p>
Web Frameworks for the client such as Backbone, Knockout, and Angular have changed how we build web applications.
Rendering's on the client now. How do you take advantage of that? Do you want to take advantage of that?
<p>
In this talk I'll walk you through an example web application that sends a skeletal UI over the wire to the browser,
then builds grid and detail views using JavaScript, out of data returned over a API implemented in Perl.
