__DESCRIPTION__

Have you ever had 0.125 pizza? Maybe 1/8th of a pizza?
Theo van Hoesel, who is also a Math teacher, explains the difference between the two.

He is also showing what 9/4/1/2 is, and what it is not.

Then he introduces [Number::Fraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Number::Fraction) and how he extended it.
