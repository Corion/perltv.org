__DESCRIPTION__

Join me in exploring the deep, dark caverns of the perl-5.12 keyword API as we implement qw(): The Next Generation.

We'll implement and test qqw(), a version of the qw() we all know and love, but with the ability to interpolate variables, just like qq(). Make a torch out of the perl optree and follow me (recursively, depth first) into the dark world of XS macros as you learn how to implement your own Perl syntax.

Some examples using [B::Deparse](https://metacpan.org/pod/B::Deparse).
