__DESCRIPTION__

Ever wanted to contribute a module to CPAN but found it difficult to navigate the in's and out's of the labyrinth? I'm a first time contributor that also found it hard to know what to do and what not to do. I still don't know everything but if you come to this talk you should leave knowing at least a little bit more about how to get your code added to CPAN.
