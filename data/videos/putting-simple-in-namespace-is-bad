__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2009.

I foolishly started a project called 'CatalystX::SimpleLogin', as with the new features offered by Catalyst 5.80, I believed it was sanely possible to provide at least *some* standard components for web application development in a standard way.

So - a login page, simplest possible application component.. Gotta be simple, right? WRONG...
