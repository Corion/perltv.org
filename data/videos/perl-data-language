__DESCRIPTION__


A small primer there on what PDL is, and for who.

* What exists outside perl: matlab / octave, c/c++, numpy, R, mathematica / maxima
* Benefits of Perl as basis compared to other languages (regexp, I/O, data cleaning, flexio)
* Great performance
* Known uses and library stacks based on PDL taken from [here](http://pdl.perl.org/?page=users).
* A solution of running this in a multiple processor environment.
* Some examples of what [Spoorgloren](http://spoorgloren.nl/) uses it for.


A large part of the work that need to be done even before the scientific analysis is cleaning up bad data.
For this Perl is much better than the other languages (FORTRANT/Pascal/C/C++/Matlab) used by scientists.

* Perl is fast for text handling: [Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Lua, tcl, javascript and Java comparison](http://raid6.com.au/~onlyjob/posts/arena/)
* PDL perfomance is also good: [Generating cool fractals](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/cool_fractals_with_perl_pdl_a_benchmark)
