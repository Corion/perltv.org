__DESCRIPTION__

Over the last couple of years I have been spending almost all of my working time actually coding Perl. This made it worthwhile to optimise my development environment. I'll talk a little about some of the tools I use which allow me to focus more on the actual development problems and less on mechanisms used to create the code.
