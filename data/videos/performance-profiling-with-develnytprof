__DESCRIPTION__

In this talk I'll be:

* reviewing the principles of performance profiling perl applications
* demonstrating how to use Devel::NYTProf
* demonstrating the new features of version 5
* explaining common traps when interpreting profile reports
* describing a multi-phase approach to optimizing applications
* [KCachegrind](http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/)

Note that the talk is almost unchanged from last year so if you've seen it before there's little reason to see it again.
