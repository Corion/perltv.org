__DESCRIPTION__

Doran Barton's presentation is a brief introduction to DBIx::Class, Perl's incredible ORM module. 

The [Salt Lake Perl Mongers group](http://saltlake.pm.org/), recently revived,
currently meets the second Tuesday of each month in space provided by Bluehost.

The presentation starts with a short review of what is [DBI](http://metacpan.org/module/DBI).
Then he gives an overview of DBIx::Class and then shows how to build the database part
of a small blog engine.

The [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/fozzmoo/introduction-to-dbixclass)
are also available to make it easier to follow the presentation.

DBI
----

* Abstraction layer between code and database
* "Easy" to migrate code from one RDBMS to another. In theory


DBIx::Class
-----------

ORM = Object Relational Mapper

* Database tables become objects
* Table data and relationships between tables become object methods

Example ORMs
--------------

* Hibernate (Java)
* SQLAlchemy (Python)
* CakePHP (PHP)
* DBIx::Class (Perl) (also called DBIC)
