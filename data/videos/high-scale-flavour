__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2010

This talk will introduce the basics of message queueing, STOMP (the Streamed Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) and AMQP (the Advanced
Message Queuing Protocol), including why message queuing is a good idea for scalability and reduced latency in web applications.

After the initial theory, an in-depth analysis will be conducted; comprising a number of useful messaging based patterns and a discussion of practical implementations, with reference to
CPAN modules available to build message based systems.
