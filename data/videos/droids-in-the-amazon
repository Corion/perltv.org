__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2009.

I'll introduce a new package - "Droids" - which is designed to manage Amazon EC2s as daemon driven web services, and I'll explain how the module is being used as the infrastructure for an e-Learning application.

My hope is that I'll get feedback from attendees who can see uses for the module in a broader context before I put it onto CPAN.
