__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2011

Some CPAN modules contain bugs or lack useful features. Many modules would benefit from better documentation. Most authors welcome contributions from the community.

Yet many Perl developers haven't yet contributed to the modules they use, for various reasons.

This talk will explain how CPAN modules work, how to edit them, how to ask for help and how to submit improvements back to their developers.

You will get the most out of this talk if you:
* have a basic or intermediate knowledge of Perl
* use CPAN modules
* have experience of editing other people's code
