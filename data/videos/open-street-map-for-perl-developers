__DESCRIPTION__

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. Despite its name, OSM offers much more than a map of streets.

This talk will begin with a summary of OpenStreetMap's data model, APIs, editing tools and map rendering process.

After that, we'll explore how Perl developers might use the data model and APIs within their own programs and look at existing parts of OpenStreetMap's toolchain that use Perl.

Attendees should have some experience of programming, ideally with Perl, but the talk assumes no experience of OpenStreetMap or other geographic information systems.

The speaker has many years experience programming Perl, a few years experience editing OpenStreetMap and a recent interest in the technical side of the map's data and interfaces.
