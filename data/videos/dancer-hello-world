__DESCRIPTION__

R Geoffrey Avery (rGeoffrey) presents this talk at the 2013 Pittsburg Perl Workshop

When attempting to learn Dancer I ran into the problem that all the documentation started from
"Here is a 'Hello World' script". But that was assuming many things were set up and configured
and that just was not true, at least not on my server.

This is a collection of what I learned.

Plus a few comments of what would be different if you wanted to use Mojolicious rather than Dancer.
