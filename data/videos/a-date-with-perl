__DESCRIPTION__

Dates and times are confusing and crazy. What nut invented Daylight Saving Time?
Someone who'd never imagined a computer, that's who!

Dealing with dates and times might seem simple at first, but there's a lot of gotchas.

This talk will start by covering some concepts worth knowing about
(What is an Olson timezone? What's the Gregorian Calendar?).

After that we'll talk about how the DateTime suite of modules can make your life a little easier.
I'll show you some best practices for working with dates and times,
and highlight some gotchas in DateTime's API, and with datetimes in general.

Notes
------

Leap Seconds are not known ahead of time.They are announced every 6 months, so the modules that handle these
need to be released in a timely fassion.


UTC = TAI (atomic time) + leap seconds to date (34)

UTC - that does not stand for anything means Coordinated Universal Time.


Dealing with dates only
-------------------------
There is no DateTime::Date Class, so there is always a time part in a DateTime object.
If you only care about the date then use *floating* time zone and
delta_md() and delta_days() methods for math.


How to Do DateTime Math Safely (at 39:05)
------------------------------------------
* Always use add(), delta_days(), subtract(), etc.
* Never write something like this:  $dt->set( day => $dt->day() + 1 )
* Use the floating time zone if you can
* Use UTC if you can - UTC has no DST changes
