__DESCRIPTION__

We hire lots of really smart people that really know software development, architecture, and scaling critical systems. There is one thing that many of them don't know and that is Perl.

How does an organization such as Booking.com tackle this challenge? In this presentation I'll share our process on growing our own Perl developers, including our successes and our lessons learned.
