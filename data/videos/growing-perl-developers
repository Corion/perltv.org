__DESCRIPTION__

The sound and the video is broken between 2:38-3:58 , please skip that part. The actual talk ends at 25:20 and then it is QA.

We hire lots of really smart people that really know software development, architecture, and scaling critical systems. There is one thing that many of them don't know and that is Perl.

How does an organization such as [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) tackle this challenge? In this presentation I'll share our process on growing our own Perl developers, including our successes and our lessons learned.



Some notes
---------


* 3,000,000 lines of code.
* Daily stand-ups in the morning hours.
* Give them important tasks immediately.
* Let them deploy in the first week, or even in the first day.
* Have seatbelts so they don't hurt themselves when they crash the car.
* Face-to-face communication.
* 2-1 the Non-Perl - Perl ratio of new hires.
* "We don't hire junior programmers, unless they have Open Source experience."

* Why [Try::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Try::Tiny) is slow.

<pre>
    eval {
       code;
       1;
    } or do {
       my $err = $@;
       # deal with error
    }
</pre>

* Abigail sits in the front row and provides frequent commentary.
