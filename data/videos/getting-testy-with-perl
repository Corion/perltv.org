__DESCRIPTION__

An introduction to testing with Perl.

[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/lembark/testy-12641024)

Unfortnately the sound is weak in the first 5 minutes of the recording, but after that it gets ok.
Then at the end, you can see how to live-test a quad-rotor UAV using Perl at 50:30.


Perl testing is kind of like swimming in the ocean: it's fun to start with but gets deep pretty quickly. Even if Test::Simple does most of the work, you'll eventually have a reason to dive into deeper waters. So, think of this talk as a glass bottomed boat: it gives you a chance to see things without getting bit or drowning...
The talk covers basics of perl testing along with mock objects and functions, using prove, filesystem-driven bulk tests and generic test modules, and ways to exercise objects in bulk.
The point of this all is to have a better feel of what can be done and where to look when the time comes.
