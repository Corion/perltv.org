__DESCRIPTION__

Andrew Rodland (hobbs) presents this talk at the 2013 Pittsburgh Perl Workshop

StatsD is a nice tool from Etsy that helps you keep track of counters and timings
from all different kinds of apps in different languages. Learn why it's cool,
see how to set it up, and learn about my new Perl client for it.

[StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/) and [Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project)
