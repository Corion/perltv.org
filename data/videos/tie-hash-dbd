__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2010

When hashes grow too big for memory, and sometimes even for DB_File, alternatives are available, but most of the time that needs a lot of recoding.

Tie::Hash::DBD is a drop-in replacement for DB_File hash ties that connects to databases a-la Tie::DBI

It supports deep nesting using Storable and persistence.
