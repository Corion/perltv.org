__DESCRIPTION__

Phil Wells is a QA engineer at Kaplan Test Prep, and in this talk he will demonstrate how he uses Perl's Selenium bindings and good old-fashioned OOP to verify the complex configuration of KTP's student portal. Attendees will leave with a good idea of what they can do to build a maintainable, resilient functional test framework.
