__DESCRIPTION__

Rust is a new programming language being developed by Mozilla for low level and systems programming tasks. Its goal is to be a replacement for C or C++ in a lot of the environments that they are currently used in (including embedded systems), while providing much stronger memory safety and concurrency guarantees, as well as other modern programming language features.

This talk will go over the basics of programming in Rust, touching on the major features that make it interesting. Knowledge of C or C++ will be helpful, although not necessary.
