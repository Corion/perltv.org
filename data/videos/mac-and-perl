__DESCRIPTION__

It's now 2014 and three years since I gave my "[Pimp Your Mac With Perl](pimp-your-mac-with-perl)" talk at YAPC::NA in Madison. In this follow up talk, consisting of entirely new material, I'll be talking about new technologies that have come along since then (having seen the prior talk is not required.)

* Writing [Alfred Plugins](http://www.alfredapp.com/), for example to search [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/)  on [GitHub](https://github.com/2shortplanks/alfred-metacpan)
* [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/)
* Using [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) to fully control your Mac with Perl using [Mac::KeyboardMaestro](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mac::KeyboardMaestro)
* Services written in Perl [ThisService](http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/)
* [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) Extensions, and brining features of an IDE to Terminal.app [source](https://github.com/2shortplanks/PerlErrorSublime.popclipext)
