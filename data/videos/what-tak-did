__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2011

I have IO::Pipeline. I have App::FatPacker. I have IPC::Command::Multiplex. And yet I still couldn't whip up a five line example of bolting them all together that made a compelling argument for a perl-loving sysadmin to stop using fabric.

This problem, among others, will be solved by the conclusion of this talk. 

Shadowcat Systems own Matt S. Trout (@shadowcat_mdk) gives the first generation of this talk.
