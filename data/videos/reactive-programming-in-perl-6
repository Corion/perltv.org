__DESCRIPTION__

In the first 20 minutes Jonathan explains the difficulties with Asynchronous programming,
and shows some examples using higher order programming techniques. Then he shows
the <b>Supply</b> class of Perl 6 and how one can combine the two ideas.

In the second half of the talk he walk through two examples.

The first example is a system that monitors the filesystem and backs up files before they are committed to Git.

The second one is a Code golf assistant.

and BTW he wrote a GTK binding for Perl 6 on his way to the conference...
