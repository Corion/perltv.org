__DESCRIPTION__

In this talk I'll show how to use tools to build web application
interfaces that will make you look like a rockstar.
Your UI can be beautiful, functional, and well tested, too.

Much like our first time on CPAN, it can be difficult
to know what tools are going to make your life easy, and make you a rockstar, and which won't.

If you're building web applications with Perl you'll want to have these time saving, happy-user creating tips, tricks, and tools at the ready. We will build a simple app using these tools so you can see them in action.

Notes
-----

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
For gettng started with good looking web site.
General guidelines and downloadable project that you can use to get roliin.

[Boilerplate Initializer](http://www.initializr.com/)
provides a template of a responsive design that will look good both on computers and on mobile devices. It also uses [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)

[Shims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing))

<b>Sprites</b> - Instead of adding million small image files it
lets you create one big image and then you use style
sheets to show specific areas of the image.

HTML Header - with lots of conditional statement specifically for IE.

[Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) detects HTML5 and CSS3 features and will tell you if
the current web browser specific features. If the feature is not supported you
can use [Polyfills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill) to support them.

[Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) is a Pollyfill for the min an max width media query style sheets.

Modernizr has a [long list of Pollyfiles](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills)

Grid system
-----------
It is like using tables but is uses divs so it is good because we are using a differen word.


[Mimosa](http://mimosa.io/) it will compile lots of Javascript and CSS files into nicely packed files that are easie for the clients to download.

Install Node.js and NPM using homebrew on a Mac

    shell> brew install npm
    shell> cd crit.do
    shell> mimosa config

    shell> mimosa watch --server --optimize --minify

[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) is a Meta language for style sheets
likes [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), SCSS or [less](http://lesscss.org/).

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)


[jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [plugins](http://plugins.jquery.com/), and
[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/).


[Bower](http://bower.io/) is a bit like CPAN for Javascript -
package management system.

[Bower components](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components)

    shell> npm install -g bower
    shell> echo '{"directory": "src/js/vendor/bower"}' > .bowerrc
    shell> bower init
    shell> bower install requirejs

[Require](http://requirejs.org/)

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) a meta language that compiles down to JavaScript.

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) (See also the talk of [Bill Humphries](/people/bill-humphries) called [Perl Meets Modern Web UI](/v/perl-meets-modern-web-ui). An MVC-style framework for JavaScript.

    shell> bower install underscore
    shell> bower install backbone
    shell> bower install backbone.localStorage


[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) 

[Moment](http://momentjs.com/)

[Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) testing framework for JavaScript.

[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) a headless browser.
