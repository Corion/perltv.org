__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2009.

Developers often advise "Don't Repeat Yourself", pointing out the dangers of copying and pasting code.

In this talk I explore the ideas of repetition and abstraction from several perspectives, explaining why I disagree with "Don't Repeat Yourself" and find limited amounts of repetition healthy.
