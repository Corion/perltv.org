__DESCRIPTION__

I was recently part of a team writing a new client to a network service which required tests across multiple layers of client code.

We needed a simple way to mock an arbitrary number of responses from the service so our tests would validate our code rather than the network.

Last night I decided to write something similar but a little more configurable.
