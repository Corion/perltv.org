__DESCRIPTION__

David Mertens is one of the core contributors to PDL.
The first 28 minutes of is an introductory talk, mostly based on the PDL Book written by
[Karl Glazebrook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Glazebrook). After that David Mertens
answers questions and provides pointers for resources.

The source of the talk is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/run4flat/yapc2012).


Some Notes
----------

The example is the Luminosity distribution of a Galaxy, of a star and near the end of the talk
(starting at about 40:30) he talks about visualizing blood glucose readings.

PDL provides 2 main things to Perl:

Speed and Compact data storage.

Because loops are running in C and data is stored in C variables.

If you are writing a for loop it is a sign that you are doing something wrong
and it is time to send an e-mail to the [PDL mailing list](http://pdl.perl.org/?page=mailing-lists).

PDL has support for *bad numbers*.
