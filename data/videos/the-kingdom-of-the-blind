__DESCRIPTION__

"In the Kingdom of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man is King"

There are plenty of places out there on the internet where One-Eyed Kings are happily dispensing dodgy Perl advice to (metaphorically) blind people.

Where are these places? How bad is the advice? And can we act as opticians. All this and other over-stretched metaphors in only five minutes.
