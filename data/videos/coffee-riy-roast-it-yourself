__DESCRIPTION__

Coffee, Java, Black gold. Whatever you may call it, coffee is a lifeblood for many of us. But yet, many of you settle for low quality, poor tasting, (and probably stale) coffee. Why? This talk will be a beginner's guide to home roasting. It's an easy, fun, and affordable way to get some of the freshest coffee possible. We will go from an everyday popcorn popper to a fully functioning machine able to roast fresh coffee in under ten minutes.
