__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2010

PostgreSQL lets you write stored procedures in PL/Perl - a Perl interpreter embedded in the database server. The PostgreSQL 9.0 release includes significant enhancements to PL/Perl.

This talk will show you how to make the best use of the new features. You'll also learn how to use Devel::NYTProf to profile your PL/Perl code, and a new efficient and sugary way to call other stored procedures.
