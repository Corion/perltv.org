__DESCRIPTION__

My grandfather served in the US Navy during World War II. His ship was sunk by the Japanese. He then spent 3.5 years as a Prisoner of War on the Burma-Thai Death Railway ("The Bridge on The River Kwai").

If all goes well, this summer I'll be scuba diving the wreck / grave site.

I can also talk about our Indiegogo crowd-funding efforts.
