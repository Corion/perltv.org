__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2010

When writing asynchronous code, it is common to pass code references around to represent what to do next after some operation completes. This is a continuation. This talk discusses this technique along with the "CPS" CPAN module, which assists with solving a number of control-flow problems.

If you are attending this talk, you may also be interested in the talk about [IO::Async](io-async).
