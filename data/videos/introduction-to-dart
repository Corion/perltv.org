__DESCRIPTION__

Dart is a new programming language from Google that you can use where you would usually use Javascript. It has classes, lexical scope, and optional static typing, making it a bit more natural than Javascript for Perl programmers. This talk will show you the basics, including the cool IDE, static analysis tools, and how to write tests.
