__DESCRIPTION__

Unicode is much more than just characters. The Unicode Consortium defines open
standards for collating, parsing, and formatting data in much of the worldâ€™s
languages. The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) is the largest standard
repository of locale data along with specifications for its use, and is a
powerful resource for software localization.

The Unicode CLDR is quickly becoming the de facto locale standard with
widespread use among companies, including Google, Apple, and IBM; projects
ranging from Linux distributions to Wikipedia; and increasing support in many
programming languages. This talk provides an introduction to software
localization and highlights popular CLDR-based open source libraries in a
variety of programming languages.

Topics include localized formatting of:

 * Numbers, percents, and ranges of numbers
 * Prices and currencies
 * Dates and times
 * Localized sorting lists of strings
