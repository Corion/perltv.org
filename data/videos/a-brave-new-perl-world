__DESCRIPTION__

Recorded at the London Perl Workshop 2011

This talk will expand upon the plan laid forth by Jesse Vincent at YAPC::NA 2011 where he talked about his ideas for the future of the Perl. In particular we will discuss the ideas for a more simplified core and the possible addition of a new MOP (Meta Object Protocol) powered object system. We will also explore what that would mean for the future of Perl 5 as a language.
