The code behind http://perltv.org/


Contributing videos?
=====================

Please add files to the data/ directory.
The file names will be the page URLs.
Please fill as many as the fields as you can and add some nice __DESCRIPTION__
For YAPC talk this can be based on the YAPC talk descriptions -
if they are available.

Please list the CPAN modules mentioned in the videos!

If you can, write a summary of the video, or if you really have time,
create a transcription. Not everyone can hear well, and not everyone can
easily understand the spoken English.
It also makes the site more searchable.

TODO
=====

Plan for hierarchy:
/v/        one page for each video
/sources   one page for each "source" such as
           "YAPC::NA 2013", or "Salt Lake Perl Mongers"
           or "
           or "Perl Maven Interviews"

/module/Module::Name
           A quick description of the module (fetched from MetaCPAN)
           and the list of videos mentioning that module.
/tag/TAG
           list of videos having that tag

/people ??? There are speakers at confernces,
     there are interviewers, there are interviewees,
     there might be several participants in a round-table discussion.
     For each person create a page with their name, some links,
     and a list of talks.

The lists of talks should include
   title, link,
   speaker (or people involved)
   source
   short description


- Either add an about page or on the main page explain what the site is about
  and how to contribute.

- On the page of the video, when the video is finished display something 
  else and not the default "select a video" option of YouTube.
  Show another random video, or show some info page?
  https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference

- Create a logo for the site and a favicon.

- Create a file about each speaker and list videos by speakers
- Create a file about each source (YAPC::NA 2013, Salt Lake Perl Mongers, etc)
  and list all the videos of this event.

- Script to update data from youtube (eg. viewer count, what else?) from yourube.

- Take idea from http://www.confreaks.com/

?- Allow people to upvode videos using their YouTube account on youtube

- Add comments ? (Disqus could be used as a start)

- Add keyword/module search.

- Integrate videos from other sources:
  http://www.presentingperl.org/
  http://yapc.tv/

- Languages:
  As an experiment add a video in Hebrew, and then ask for help to add videos
  in other languages as well.


NOT TODO
=========
- Check if we could display some other picture in place of the video before
  even it starts. (e.g. some information about the site?

- The front page should have a large thumbnail of the current video
  The real content including the video will be only on the internal pages only.

  Automatically starting the replay will not be counted by YouTube so we cannot have
  a link on the front page to the specific page and autostart the video there. :(
  Therefore we keep the video on the front page.
