The code behind http://perltv.org/


TODO

- list all the entries with specific tag
- list all the entries mentioning a module (?) and link to MetaCPAN
- Add the copyright and license information to the site as well.
- Add social icons (G+, Twitter, FB)
- Add a thumbnail from the video to get it displayed
  when sharing on Google+ and Facebook.
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068344/how-to-get-thumbnail-of-youtube-video-link-using-youtube-api/2068371#2068371

- Either add an about page or on the main page explain what the site is about
  and how to contribute.
- The front page should have a large thumbnail of the current video
  and smaller thumbnails for a few of the older ones. The real
  content including the video will be only on the internal pages only.


Contributing videos?

Please add files to the data/ directory.
The file names will be the page URLs.
Please fill as many as the fields as you can and add some nice __DESCRIPTION__
For YAPC talk this can be based on the YAPC talk descriptions -
if they are available.

Please list the CPAN modules mentioned in the videos!

If you can, write a summary of the video, or if you really have time,
create a transcription. Not everyone can hear well, and not everyone can
easily understand the spoken English.
It also makes the site more searchable.
