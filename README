The code behind http://perltv.org/


TODO

- list all the entries mentioning a module (?) and link to MetaCPAN
- add sitemap.xml
- on the main page show the currently featured video
- Add the copyright and license information to the site as well.
- set the title of each page to be that of the video
- Add social icons (G+, Twitter, FB)


Contributing videos?

Please add files to the data/ directory.
The file names will be the page URLs.
Please fill as many as the fields as you can and add some nice __DESCRIPTION__
For YAPC talk this can be based on the YAPC talk descriptions -
if they are available.

Please list the CPAN modules mentioned in the videos!

If you can, write a summary of the video, or if you really have time,
create a transcription. Not everyone can hear well, and not everyone can
easily understand the spoken English.
It also makes the site more searchable.
